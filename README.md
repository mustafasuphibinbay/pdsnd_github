### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data using Python

### Description

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, I wrote a Python script to explore data provided by [link](https://www.motivateco.com/ "Motivate"), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

My Python script provides the following information:

**Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

**Popular stations and trip**

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**Trip duration**

- total travel time
- average travel time

**User info**

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth
